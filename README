This Rails plugin adds a helper called #summarizer which reduces a html fragment to a few words of text.  This is intended for short post summaries.  Not perfect, but much better than the truncate / strip_tags methods used in the rest of the Rails world.

Usage:

  In a view:

    <%= summarizer html %>

  Input example:

    "<p><i>(This has been sitting as a draft for a while, time to release it to the world.)</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEVEN THINGS YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT AN ACTIVERAIN DEVELOPER BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Video game fanatic.  Just about weekly for the past 10 years, I've purchased a video game, and then grown tired of it in days.  Only a select few have retained my interest for years (like Team Fortress 2 and Dwarf Fortress.)"

  Output example:

    ...

Installation:

  Install the plugin into vendor/plugins/summarizer

  In app/helpers/application_helper.rb add:
 
    include SummarizerHelper
